      "job": "Internship Thrivent Financial (Summer 2022)",
      "description": "Worked as a frontend intern for Thriventâ€™s unauthenticated experience team. Using agile with scrum development I was able to complete over 20 stories for the team.  Starting off with accessibility stories, I quickly advanced onto helping the team develop new features and components for the project. A large part of role was coordination with other teams such as design, content, and backend. My three month long internship got extended by a few weeks so I could stay on to help the team, and I gained great technical experience from this role."
